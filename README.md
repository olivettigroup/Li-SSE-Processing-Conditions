# Li-SSE-Processing-Conditions
Public release of data for the processing conditions of Li SSEs

This data is a companion to the paper, " Text Mining for Processing Conditions of Solid-State Battery Electrolytes."

## Table 1
Table 1 includes the text-mined ceramic processing steps (or operation names) and the associated times and temperatures for the synthesis of following Li solid-state electrolytes (SSEs):
a) Li2S-P2S5 b) Li7P3S11 c) ÃŸ-Li3PS4 d) Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) and e) Li garnets (Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) type)

The table columns are: 1) doi 2) publication year 3) target (material) 4) operation name 5) temperature (C) 6) time (hr)

The operations listed are dry, sinter, anneal, calcine, fire and heat. Within each doi the operation names are listed following the same order as they appear in the main article.
